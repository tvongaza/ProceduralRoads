# ProceduralRoads

A Valheim mod that generates procedural roads connecting locations across your world.

## Features

- Automatically generates roads from spawn to nearby points of interest
- Terrain-aware pathfinding that follows natural contours
- Configurable road width, length, and count

## Installation

1. Install [BepInEx](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/)
2. Install [Jotunn](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ValheimModding/Jotunn/)
3. Drop `ProceduralRoads.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`

## Configuration

Edit `warpalicious.ProceduralRoads.cfg` in `BepInEx/config/`:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| RoadWidth | 4 | Road width in meters (2-10) |
| IslandRoadPercentage | 50 | Percentage of islands that will have roads (0-100). Largest islands selected first. |
| CustomLocations | (empty) | Comma-separated list of location names to include in road generation |
| Bridges/Enabled | false | **Prototype.** Let roads cross rivers on ruined wooden bridges (see below) |
| Bridges/CostFixed | 60000 | Pathfinding cost of a bridge, fixed part; lower = more bridges |
| Bridges/CostPerMeter | 600 | Pathfinding cost of a bridge per metre of span |

### Custom Locations via Config

Use the `CustomLocations` setting to add locations from other mods (e.g., Expand World Data):

```
CustomLocations = Runestone_Boars,Runestone_Greydwarfs,MerchantCamp
```

### Bridges (prototype, off by default)

With `Bridges/Enabled = true` a road may cross a river instead of stopping at
it. The pathfinder can jump a river in a straight line, up to 128 m from dry
ground to dry ground and only between near-level banks, at the configured
cost; the cost is high, so a bridge appears where the way around is long or
there is none. The water under the jump is never leveled or painted: the
road runs down to the water's edge on each side and a ruined wooden bridge
is spawned between the banks from vanilla pieces (`wood_pole2` post pairs
stacked down to the riverbed, `wood_beam` crossbeams, a `wood_floor` plank
deck) when the zone generates. The bridge is a ruin: piers survive more than
the deck, and a navigation gap around the deepest water is always left open
so boats still pass. Pieces are ordinary persistent objects with damage
states, so unmodded clients see them too.

The setting decides how a network is generated; a world generated with
bridges keeps them if it is turned off later. Bridges need the pathfinder to
exhaust the land routes first, so on large islands raise
`PathfindingMaxIterations` to let it find them. `road_bridges` in the console
lists the bridge sites nearest to you; `road_bridges respawn` rebuilds the
spawned pieces from the current plans.

## API for Mod Authors

Other mods can register locations for road generation programmatically.

### Direct Reference (if embedding or referencing the DLL)

```csharp
using ProceduralRoads;

// Register a location
RoadNetworkGenerator.RegisterLocation("MyCustomLocation");

// Unregister if needed
RoadNetworkGenerator.UnregisterLocation("MyCustomLocation");

// Get all registered locations
IReadOnlyCollection<string> locations = RoadNetworkGenerator.GetRegisteredLocations();
```

### Reflection (soft dependency, no DLL reference required)

```csharp
private static void RegisterRoadLocation(string locationName)
{
    var assembly = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()
        .FirstOrDefault(a => a.GetName().Name == "ProceduralRoads");

    if (assembly == null) return;

    var generatorType = assembly.GetType("ProceduralRoads.RoadNetworkGenerator");
    var method = generatorType?.GetMethod("RegisterLocation", 
        System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Public | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Static);

    method?.Invoke(null, new object[] { locationName });
}
```

### Available API Methods

| Method | Signature | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `RegisterLocation` | `void RegisterLocation(string locationName)` | Add a location to road generation |
| `UnregisterLocation` | `void UnregisterLocation(string locationName)` | Remove a location from road generation |
| `GetRegisteredLocations` | `IReadOnlyCollection<string> GetRegisteredLocations()` | Get all registered location names |

### Notes

- Register locations during mod initialization (Awake/Start)
- Location names must match the prefab name exactly (e.g., `Runestone_Boars`, not `Runestone Boars`)
- Both API registrations and config entries are merged at generation time
