    ///   - A NEW world generates its locations in a coroutine that sets
    ///     ZoneSystem.LocationsGenerated through the property setter, and the
    ///     setter raises GenerateLocationsCompleted. The event arrives, late.
    ///   - An OLD-FORMAT save goes through ZoneSystem.LoadOld, which also uses
    ///     the setter, so the event arrives -- but from inside ZNet's load
    ///     routine, before it has returned. This is not a pre-1.0 path: it is
    ///     what 1.0 runs the first time a player opens a world they saved
    ///     before updating.
    ///   - A 1.0-FORMAT save goes through ZoneSystem.Load, which writes the
    ///     backing field straight from the save and skips the setter. No event
    ///     is raised at all, however early we subscribed.
    ///
    /// So the event cannot be dropped in favour of asking the game, and asking
    /// the game cannot be dropped in favour of the event: two of the three
    /// doors only announce themselves, and the third only ever shows its state.
    ///
    /// RoadNetworkGenerator.IsLocationsReady covers both: it accepts either
    /// having been told or the game simply being in that state. What it must
    /// never do is stand in for the other half. Locations being in place says
    /// nothing about whether the world's ZDOs are in memory, and the saved
    /// network lives in a ZDO -- so the world-data gate below stays. That gate
    /// is a postfix on ZNet.ServerLoadWorld: the whole load routine has
    /// returned, which is a guarantee that does not depend on the order of the
    /// steps inside it. Without it an existing world could build a second
    /// network over the one it saved, and no one would be told.
