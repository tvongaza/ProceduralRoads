# Road approach validation and follow-ups

## Accepted scope — PR #21

The implementation seeks near-level exterior arrivals, protects location terrain and paint, limits planned road grades, and gives climbing switchbacks room to turn. A site may remain disconnected when a safe route cannot be built. Stairs are a separate future feature.

Manual inspection on 18 September 2026 used a combined integration build carrying this approach code alongside the network and bridge work:

- Frost cave: the user accepted the approach from the more level side. A small natural bump inside the protected location remains intentionally unchanged.
- Tar pit: the user confirmed the road skirts the pit.
- Troll cave: the user accepted the approach.

The regenerated island had 9 roads / 6,215 m, compared with 15 / 14,174 m before the turn constraints. Generation took 608.1 s versus 305.9 s at the same retained high-budget settings (100,000 search iterations, 30 locations per island). This is one island on the combined build, not a PR-only benchmark or a default-settings performance claim. Fewer connected sites were accepted; alternative-search cost is a follow-up.

Automated tests cover turn geometry, landing grades, the terrain-height fitter on a synthetic plane, refusal of pinched turns, protected sites, location/road terrain composition and approach selection. Rock-clearing implementation and tests have been removed from this PR for a separate follow-up. Individual switchback terrain is not comprehensively validated in game.

## Separate future PR — natural rock clearance

Rock clearing is outside #21. Preserve the current candidate on `pr/road-rock-clearing` and develop it separately before publishing a PR. The running combined inspection build still contains the earlier clearing code; removing it from #21 does not change that game session.

- Expand beyond Mountains, Plains and Black Forest to evaluate Mistlands explicitly. Inspect actual prefabs and vegetation registration, including scale and collider geometry; distinguish natural obstacles from ore, resources and authored POI structures.
- Diagnose the observed `rock2_mountain` near X1176.5, Z4323.1 that remained despite already being eligible by name. Check actual collider overlap, protection and ownership decisions before claiming a fix.
- Test road-overlap removal, preservation of nearby rocks and protected scenery, ownership transfer, and save/reload behavior. Keep removal free of damage/drop side effects.
- Bound the loaded-zone work and allocations before broadening to Mistlands' larger formations. Decide which formations should make routing avoid them instead of deleting them.

## TODO — approaches and turn coverage

- Compare a route through the col toward the front of Hildir's cave when reliable entrance data is available. Location centre alone does not establish a doorway.
- Check terrain overlap between separate roads; current switchback separation checks legs of one reshaped path.
- Profile alternative-search work after turn rejection if further generation speed work is needed. Do not restore unsafe turns merely to increase connectivity.
- Keep the accepted cave's protected natural bump intact. A closer entrance connection needs real entrance/collision data.

## TODO — bridge PR #26: limit height to structurally supported spans

User observation, 18 September 2026: a very tall bridge on the island just toured in RoadSeedE had structural supports fail. Exact crossing coordinates and the failure mechanism have not yet been captured; height is the suspected cause, not a confirmed diagnosis.

- Identify the crossing and check vanilla support propagation for the actual deck, pier and beam prefabs, including terrain contact and ruined support gaps.
- Establish a supported height/span limit from those rules; reject or lower a bridge that cannot support its intended intact layout, while preserving POI terrain and usable approaches. Do not force a crossing when no valid layout fits.
- Add boundary tests for the limit and a regression for this crossing. Verify in game that the intended surviving structure remains stable after physics settles and after reload; deliberate ruin must remain distinct from unintended collapse.

This belongs to bridge PR #26, separately from the current #21 approach and boulder work.
