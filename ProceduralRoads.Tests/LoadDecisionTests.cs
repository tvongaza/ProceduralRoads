/// <summary>
/// When the mod decides whether to load a saved road network or build a new
/// one.
///
/// Getting this wrong is expensive and silent: a world that already had roads
/// generates a second network over the top of the one it saved, and the player
/// never learns that the first is gone. It happened, and it happened because
/// the decision was taken too early -- reading an old-format save sets
/// ZoneSystem's LocationsGenerated, and that setter raises
/// GenerateLocationsCompleted from inside ZNet's load routine, before the
/// routine has returned and before the mod can rely on finding anything.
///
/// So the decision waits for both halves -- locations ready, and the world's
/// data read -- and is taken by whichever arrives last. These tests hold that
/// in both arrival orders, which is not academic: a saved world raises the
/// locations event during its own load, a fresh one long afterwards.
///
/// Valheim 1.0 added a third case that looks like neither. Its chunked loader
/// (ZoneSystem.Load) writes the LocationsGenerated field directly instead of
/// through the property setter, so the event is not raised early -- it is not
/// raised at all. The other two doors survive on 1.0 and still raise it: a new
/// world's location coroutine, and ZoneSystem.LoadOld, which is what 1.0 runs
/// the first time a player opens a world saved before they updated. The last
/// two tests cover the silent door, and hold that it still does not excuse the
/// world-data gate.
