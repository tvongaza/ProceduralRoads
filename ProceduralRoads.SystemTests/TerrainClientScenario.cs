/// The maintained end-to-end terrain and paint persistence check, run against a world that prepare-terrain wrote and

/// owned server once it accepts game connections, is protected, arrives on the fixture's dry support point, and measures
/// heights and colliders, paint, and stationary support against the prepared plans, whose expectations came from native
/// pre-write inputs, never from these readings. Then a confirmed save, the client leaves, the server restarts, the client
/// rejoins and everything is measured again. Every step must pass: a prepared fixture or a paint pass never stands in for
/// grounding, and the restart round never reuses the first round's readings. The client is closed in every outcome: an
/// owned client's process is stopped, an attached one is left running.
